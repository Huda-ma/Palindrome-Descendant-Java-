# Palindrome-Descendant-Java-
 A number may not be a palindrome but its descendant can be.
 A number's direct child is created by summing each pair of adjacent digits to create the digits of the next number.
 for instance 123312 is not a palindrome, but its next child 363 is, where 3=1+2; 6=3+3; 3=2+1;
 
 create a function that retirns true if the numbre itself is a palindrome or any of its descendants.
